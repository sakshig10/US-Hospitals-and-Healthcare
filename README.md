# Hackathon: US-Hospitals-and-Healthcare
According to recent studies, only seven percent of Americans are satisfied with the current healthcare system. Uneven care has left health consumers unsatisfied since they are receiving different levels of care determined not by standardized quality but by their location, condition, or insurance plan. Rural areas might not have enough hospitals, while urban cities may have an overflux of healthcare resources and facilities. 

This project aims to trace this disparity in the US healthcare system and answer underlying questions to understand and fix this broken system. We perform an in-depth analysis to compare metrics related to the infrastructure and population of the states that are performing well versus those lagging in terms of healthcare resources.

Key Features
-Utilization of data and other relevant features to assess the impact of healthcare infrastructure on different states.
-In-depth analysis to uncover the underlying factors contributing to healthcare disparities.
-Extensive use of powerful R packages, including dplyr, ggplot2, plotly, tidyr, and others, for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

This project reveals disparities in the US healthcare infrastructure and analyzes contributing factors. The key findings include wide disparities in bed ratios, non-profit hospitals playing a vital role in healthcare infrastructure, and ownership as a major factor influencing healthcare performance.
